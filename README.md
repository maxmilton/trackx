# TrackX ![](./packages/trackx-dash/static/favicon.ico)

Simple, lightweight, and privacy-friendly error tracking. A self-hosted platform to capture JavaScript errors in web browsers, Node.js, and other runtime environments, capture browser reports, and analyse the data on a real-time monitoring dashboard.

Try it for yourself at <https://demo.trackx.app>.

> **WIP**; Most features already work, however, not everything is 100%. Namely, the documentation is unfinished and capturing browser reports (CSP violations, NEL reports, etc.) is still experimental.

## Usage
